This is my first solo project outside of school. I'm using this to show what I am capible of and to see how far I've come in the future. 

For the API key needed in the weather.py go to this website https://openweathermap.org/ and create an account. Then click on API keys under your username, there you'll be able to create an 
API key for the weather section.

Another thing is that when trying to run the game it may show that it's a virus I can assure you it's not I just don't know how to run it without that error, sorry.

Thank you for checking out my code :),

James
